# The Pizza Order Website

## Tools

React, Redux, TailwindCSS

## Functions

👉 Users can order one or more pizzas from a menu  
👉 Requires no user accounts and no login: users just input their names before using the app  
👉 The pizza menu can change, so it should be loaded from an API  
👉 Users can add multiple pizzas to a cart before ordering  
👉 Ordering requires just the user’s name, phone number, and address  
👉 If possible, GPS location should also be provided, to make delivery easier  
👉 User’s can mark their order as “priority” for an additional 20% of the cart price  
👉 Orders are made by sending a POST request with the order data (user data + selected pizzas) to the API  
👉 Payments are made on delivery, so no payment processing is necessary in the app  
👉 Each order will get a unique ID that should be displayed, so the user can later look up their order based on the ID  
👉 Users should be able to mark their order as “priority” order even after it has been placed
